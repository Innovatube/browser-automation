SUMMARY - WHILE ATTEMPTING TO TRANSFORM HAND-WRITTEN FLOW PROJECT TEST CASES TO TEST SCRIPTS:
	
- Selenese Script is a simplified test script that QAs can use to write tests quickly.
- JavaScript code using WebDriver API is more advanced but require more time and effort.

- Some of the test cases are transformable into WebDriver code but not Selenese script:

- Even with WebDriver API, some test cases that requires look-and-feel judgement is not fully transformable to automated test.

PROBLEM WITH SELENESE SCRIPT:

- Mouse hovering & checking element attribute when hovered are not working

- Not supporting all XPath attribute query (class name)
