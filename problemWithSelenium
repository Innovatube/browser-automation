SUMMARY - WHILE ATTEMPTING TO TRANSFORM HAND-WRITTEN FLOW PROJECT TEST CASES TO TEST SCRIPTS:
	
- Selenese Script is a simplified test script that QAs can use to write tests quickly.
- JavaScript code using WebDriver API is more advanced but require more time and effort.

- Some of the test cases are transformable into WebDriver code but not Selenese script:

- Even with WebDriver API, some test cases that requires look-and-feel judgement is not fully transformable to automated test.

=======================================
PROBLEM WITH SELENESE SCRIPT:

- Mouse hovering & checking element attribute when hovered are not working

- Not supporting XPath fully. The documentation suggest using XPath Checker extension but SeleniumIDE cannot recognise XPath produced by the extension.

- Query element by CSS class results in either:
  + Complex XPath query {contains(concat(‘ ‘,normalize-space(@class),’ ‘),’ vcard ‘)} instead of {@class="vcard"} which is not working.

  + Usage of DOM query: document.getElementsByClassName('listMenu')
  (not very friendly to tester, but better in this case)

  + 

- Verifying URL Location with hashbang (https://beta.flowzone.cloud/#Team) is not supported.

- Checking pop-ups links is impossible (must use WebDriver)

=> Documenting is poor. This is the root of all the above problems. Require a lot of trails and error to really understand how it works.
